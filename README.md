# coinflip
A program that allows you to set up automatic coin flips while keeping scores across several artifical players. It even has a display to make it user friendly!

This is the result of me learning pygame and classes, and how they work together. The result looks pretty good and it's pretty fun working with classes in general. So I will definitely use what I learned in the future. All you need to run the script is to have pygame installed (and also python ofc).

This program is pretty simple once you take a look at it but for me it's impossible to explain. The program takes advantage of the ability to create multiple instances from a class. Let's imagine this: every second or so, all artifical players(That are sorted by color) will flip a invisibe coin. The result is will most likely not be the same thanks to classes. If a player wins a coin flip, they will receive a point. First player to reach a set point limit wins and the program stops. It's basically a race. Also thanks to pygame there is a window that allows you to see all this happen.

All you have to do is open the program and the race will start automatically. (You do have to close and reopen the program to restart the race though) There are a couple variable you can change in the script like: The point limit, how much time will pass between coin flips, and the chance of winning the coin flip. You can even change the amount of players participating in the race by adding and removing two lines of code!
